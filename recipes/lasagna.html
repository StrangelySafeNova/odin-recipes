        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef and sausage</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
            <li>Spices</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>Mozzarella</li>
            <li>Lasagna pasta</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Tomato paste</li>
            <li>Frozen spinach (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cheese filling</strong>: For this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with seasonings and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</li>
            <li><strong>Meat</strong>: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Sauce</strong>: To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or <a href="https://www.spendwithpennies.com/easy-marinara-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marinara sauce</a> (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer).</li>
            <li><strong>Spinach (variation)</strong>: To make a spinach lasagna, squeeze out most of the moisture of defrosted frozen spinach and add it along with the cheese layer.</li>
        </ul>
